# TODO

- Renderer does the rendering, the chunk is just a model. It just holds data, it doesn´t create a mesh.
- Function inside chunk to check if block at any direction (enum) is solid or not.
- Not render face if block next to it is solid.
- Classes for every type of cube, each one with their atlas coordinates.
- Player.
- Placing/removing blocks.
- Inventory.
- Chunks.
- Procedural terrain generation.
- Lighting.
- Consistent naming style.

# BUGS
